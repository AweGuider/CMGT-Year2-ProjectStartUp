Once upon a time, there was a young mouse named Bob. At first glance, there were not a lot of things remarkable about him. His pyjama covered his tiny frame, his eyes were round and his ears looked almost too big for his head. His room was small, on the right side of the attic, nicely kept, with lots of drawing on the walls. This night he stayed in front of his small window, watching mesmerized the autumn night sky while counting each and every star. But something was different this night, there was a new star in the sky. Bob put his little hands on the cold wet window frame, his eyes started sparkling and all of a sudden, the star just fell and created a playful game of light and color. Bob just put his hands together to his heart and just fell asleep while making his wish, to have the greatest adventure.

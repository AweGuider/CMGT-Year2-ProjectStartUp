“But Barney, I know what I saw! I know there is something special about this, please, trust me only this time. I promise, I will do all the work, I will listen to you, and … and…” Bob startled while trying to hold his tears back.
Barney sighed, crouched, and looked Bob in the eyes “ You know what? If you promise you will collect all the herbs we need, we can look around after your magic star.”
 Bob jumped excitedly about this compromise and gleefully started to collect all the herbs and berries in his way. Barney softly smiled and followed Bob along the path. 
After some time of hard work Barley dropped his basket out of the blue. All the berries and herbs scattered and started to slowly roll over the dirty ground. 
“Barney?” asked Bob confused. “What is that?” said Barney while pointing at a shiny object in the distance.

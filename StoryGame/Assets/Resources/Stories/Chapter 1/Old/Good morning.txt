"Good morning, sweetheart," the mother says and lovingly pets his head as she scurries by to get him a plate and some corn for breakfast. Then she yells for his siblings to come eat, as she sets the table for them, too.

It doesn't even take Fabian a minute to answer the mother's call. When he appears, he enters the house from outside, carrying bundles of fire wood for the stove, seemingly unaffected by their weight.

Very unlike his younger brother Fabian is tall, even taller than their father has been and years of hard work have made him durable. The old wooden floor creaks under his weight as he carries the wood over to the stove, slightly dragging his feet as he walks.

He pats Felix's shoulder firmly and murmurs 'Morning', before sitting down to eat. 
In contrast, Daria appears fashionably late, scurrying over to her place without a word of greeting. She carelessly drags the basket she takes to the woods to carry her pickings over the ground. 

A single look at her sour face tells Felix that she is not in a good mood today. Not that she has been in a good mood ever since fall set in and the busy days of hoarding food for the winter months has begun.

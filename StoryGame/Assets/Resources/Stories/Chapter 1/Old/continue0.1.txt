As Felix's thoughts wander to distant/far away lands and unknown adventures, dawn draws near. Too soon the rising sun starts to tints the skies orange and pink. 

Its rays crawl over the horizon and touch the house and the vast fields sourrounding it with golden fingers, wiping away the night's feeling of limitless possibilities.

Felix, fearless adventurer, discoverer of hidden secrets, conquerer of evil forces and savior of the helpess crowd fades with the stars. 

Left behind sits Felix, youngest son, small and thin and unimpressive, squinting his dark eyes at the sudden brightness and turning away from the window to get dressed.

Through the wooden floor he hears the muffled noises of his family waking up and getting ready for another busy day. Just like every day.

He can hear the clattering of kitchen utensils downstairs, his brother Fabian's calm and steady steps. Somewhere below he can hear his sister's voice. Even though he does not understand what she is saying, the tone of voice tells him that she is complaining about something as usual.  

Felix sighs as he trots down the stairs. One part of him accepts the inevitability of another day far from extraordinary. It wants to duck its head and get it over with.

But another part, the dreamer, has not given up just yet. Maybe today, it whispers as Felix pushes the kitchen door open. Maybe today is the day everything changes.

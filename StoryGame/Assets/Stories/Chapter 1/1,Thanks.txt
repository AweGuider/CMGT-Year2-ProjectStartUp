Felix's voice sounds a little bitter, but Fabian chooses to ignore it. "No problem," Fabian responds nonchalantly.

"Maybe you should help him carry the basket, too." Daria's snarky remark hits Felix, but it is not really unexpected. 

"But then he can't carry you on his back to protect you from the evil bugs," Felix mocks.
Daria's nose twitches with agitation. Everyone in the house knows she despises the bugs swarming the bushes she has to check for berries and would give a lot to switch tasks with her younger brother.

 "How about I mind my own business instead?," Fabian asks seemingly unconcerned between to bites of corn. "It's not like my job is to babysit you both. Or to stop you fom fighting non-stop, by the way. Just act like the grown-ups you claim to be and we'll all be fine."

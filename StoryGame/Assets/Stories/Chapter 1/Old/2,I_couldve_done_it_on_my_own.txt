At the other end of the table Daria huffs, her black eyes glistening with malice. "Sure thing," she says, rising her twitching nose into the air as she closes the front buttons of her coat. "Would be the first time you'd do anything without messing it up, though."

"Stop it, Daria," Fabian says sharply.
"What?" she replies, daring to look offended. 

"Am I the one being spared the darned forst for being too fragile to set foot in it or is it him? All he has to do is take a stroll and scout the area while we crawl through those bug-infested woods every day."

"At least he can tell poisonous plants from edible ones," Fabian says utterly unimpressed. "While you almost poisoned us not only once, but twice this year already."

"I'll gladly switch," Felix shouts angrily and drops the rest of his corn back to his plate. "Then you can crawl through the grass with your oh-so-pretty nose in the dirt and-"

"Just wait, you littly-" Daria jumps up from her chair, her eyes narrowed to angry slits.

"Stop fighting already!" Their mother says loudly, her voice allows no backtalking. She swings the long wooden spoon like a sword as she points at one child after the other.

"Daria, stop playing the princess. You know I depend on you. Fabian, take care of her out there, okay? And you -" she fixes her stern gaze on Felix who knows exactly she will say next.

"You don't set a single food into the woods. Is that clear? Check the area around near the river for peas and parsley, but don't even think of going near the water. Stay in sight so I can check on you." 

All in the mood for rebellion, Felix is about to open his mouth to argue, but his mother shuts the protest down before he can utter a single word.

"No! Don't give me that look, you heard me. No woods, no closer than 10 metres to river. And now, get out of here, all of you!"
And with this, she shoos the children out of the door.

Silently Felix slips on his chair. 

"Oh, please don't tell me you're in a bad mood, too. One grumpy teenager in the house is more than enough," his mother sighs as she hands him a plate with some corn for breakfast.

As she walks past the worn out chair across from Felix's seat, she absent-mindedly grazes the worn-out wood with her finger tips. Felix's father's seat has been empty formore than a year now. Ever since the morning he left the house and never returned. 

Before that day, the mother has kept an eye on her youngest. Now, it feels as if he is constantly watched as she desperately tries to keep him away from the world that beckons him to explore.

While Felix chews his sweet corn and stares outside the window, his mother sets the table for his siblings, too and shouts their names.

It doesn't even take Fabian a minute to answer the mother's call. When he appears, he enters the house from outside, carrying bundles of fire wood for the stove, seemingly unaffected by their weight.

Very unlike his younger brother Fabian is tall, even taller than their father has been and years of hard work have made him durable. The old wooden floor creaks under his weight as he carries the wood over to the stove, slightly dragging his feet as he walks.

He pats Felix's shoulder firmly and murmurs 'Morning', before sitting down to eat. 
In contrast, Daria appears fashionably late, scurrying over to her place without a word of greeting. She carelessly drags the basket she takes to the woods to carry her pickings over the ground. 

A single look at her sour face tells Felix that she is not in a good mood today. Not that she has been in a good mood ever since fall set in and the busy days of hoarding food for the winter months has begun.

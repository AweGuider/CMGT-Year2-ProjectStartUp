Follow your dreams, people say. You can make them come true.

But sometimes that is far easier said than done, I'm afraid. From the moment one musters the courage to leave the  comforting warmth of the bed, it can be difficult to pursue a far-off seeming dream while very real struggles await.

But the night... the night belongs to the dreamers. 

The young mouse boy looking at the autumn night sky through the tiny window of his attic room knows this too well. A slightly too large pyjama covers his tiny frame, his eyes and round ears almost look a bit too big to fit his head. 

There is nothing remarkable about him at first glance. The only thing drawing attention is the fresh band aid wrapped around the end of his tale that he scratches absent-mindedly as he gazes at the stars. It covers a tiny cut whose cause he will never tell his mother about.

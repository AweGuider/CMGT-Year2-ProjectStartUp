Bob ran towards his brother and crouched down to pick up his basket.”Barney, maybe we should go home, I think this is dangerous!”
Barney turned around and with a mocking tone told Bob ”Oh, but I thought you were ready for an adventure, or were you not?”
Hearing Barney belittle him, Bob’s ears heated with embarrassment and anger. Wasn’t the big brother supposed to be the responsible one, not him? 
The wind started to pick up softly and the leaves were gently falling off the trees. Now the scene was like a beautiful painting. The white trees and the orange leaves were creating a magnificent scene while the brothers seemed even smaller. The two of them seemed almost lost by themselves in the middle of this forest.
“Come on Bob, you always say that you will be like dad. But now you are too scared to explore when something this interesting happens for the first time?”
